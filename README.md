### Setup and Installation

We recommend to setup this in a virtual environment like anaconda.<br>
To create an environment, open Anaconda prompt and execute this on the terminal
```
conda create -n codev20
```
or (to install all dependencies)
```
conda create -n codev20 python tensorflow SpeechRecognition nltk numpy PyAudio
```
If you want to install the packages manually, you can do it also using pip. Here arre the packages required:
<ul><li> <b>tensorflow</b> (400+ MB size so it may take a while download and install)</li>
<li> <b>SpeechRecognition</b></li>
<li> <b>nltk</b></li>
<li> <b>numpy</b> (not sure it's already included on tensorflow)</li>
<li> <b>PyAudio</b></li></ul>

Example:
```
pip install tensorflow
```
